# ðŸŽ® Java 2D RPG Adventure Game

Hello, this is a repo containing the source code for a Java 2D game that I am working on. Currently, the core of the game is done but there are a lot of enhancements and improvements that I am planning to make in the future.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Personally, I started this project because I am interested in game development. As I go through the project, I also found that it helped me with understanding some concepts that I wasn't
quite grasping at work (interfaces, abstract classes and design patterns) and develop my programming skills in Java. My enjoyment and learning experience are the
two things that kept me working on and improving the game.

## ðŸ“„ Description

This is a single-player game that follows a main character who is trying to find their way back to Earth. The game can be played with the controls that are
specified inside the game and requires JRE to be installed on the play computer.

I used Java because it was a language I felt I had neglected to improve in a long time and wanted to get back on track with it.
I chose Java Swing as the tool to draw and render my GUI simply because it's quite straightforward to use and I wanted to focus more on the programming side. The resources - images, sound effects, music - I downloaded and installed from
online sources and tutorials since I didn't want to touch this part (yet) at this point.

I found that at the start, due to my seriously poor knowledge of object oriented programming, I was struggling to utilize this paradigm
in modularizing and improve my game efficiency. I also initially struggled at doing the GUI correctly and developing correct algorithms for the in-game
systems simply because I was very much lacking in experience. However, through time commitment, research and experience, I got through these hurdles.

## ðŸ”­ Work in progress
- Character storyline
- Rendering enhancements
- New game mechanics
- New attack and animation mechanics
- New monsters and bosses
